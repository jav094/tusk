     CHECK DEVICES
     *  check for currently connected bluetooth audio peripherals
            * this app will play the role of a central by implementing CBCentralManager: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corebluetooth/cbcentralmanager
            * and it will show information about connected CBPeripheral objects: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corebluetooth/cbperipheral
            * grab the name of the peripheral, which should be a CBCharacteristic: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corebluetooth/cbcharacteristic
     *  check for any currently connected wired headphones
            * what if both wired and bluetooth are connected at once? Is that possible?
     *  if no bluetooth or wired, check if regular speakers are working
     *  check if the connected device is muted
     *  if none of these happen, probably got an error?
     
     UPDATE STATUS ITEM
     *  show the icon and name for the connected audio in the menu bar's status item
     
     LISTEN FOR CHANGES
     *  if the connected audio device changes, update the status item
